                        <p>With its visually appealing and consistent layout and concept, Project Lima’s advocacy for understanding neurodivergence successfully informs and educates its visitors through immersive interactions. It promotes a creative way in understanding different types of neurodivergence, as well as design inclusivity and mindful web-development. Although a lot is going on in the background, such as animations and videos, the text is still readable. Simple colors and fonts were used to contrast the vibrant and dynamic background. No colors were clashing and the content of the page were fairly and consistently spaced. To add, the website still looks cohesive and responsive when using screens aside from a desktop monitor.</p>

                        <p>The many images and multimedia elements found in the site do not include the appropriate alt attributes needed. This can negatively affect the user’s experience if images do not load since the site’s concept and information are heavily reliant on its visual elements. The site only allows mouse scrollwheel (scroll down to proceed and up to go back) and mouse clicks in order to navigate the website. Once you click the “exit from experience” button, it will open a tab for the creators of the website, Project Lima.</p>

                        <h4><em>Perceivable</em></h4>
                        <p>The site is able to present all its information. It made use of images and videos meaningful to the concept and are intractable so users can easily navigate around, jumping from one subject to another all the while being able to jump back to where they previously were.</p>
                        <h4><em>Operable</em></h4>
                        <p>The site is responsive to desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. However, one cannot navigate around the website with just the keyboard alone. The introduction of the website is very reliant on the user’s mouse scrollwheel. Despite this, the users can easily interact with all the different elements. Some lines of texts include hidden URLs that direct users to supporting sources. It is not difficult to spot and seamlessly transitions within the theme of the website.</p>
                        <h4><em>Understandable</em></h4>
                        <p>Project Lima aims to educate its visitors the concepts and importances of neurodivergence. It is abundant in providing different terms that branch out to more information to further explain them. The texts do not include jargon and complex sentences.</p>
                        <h4><em>Robust</em></h4>
                        <p>It is accessible to different web browsers and devices. The site loads quickly and responds efficiently to user interactions, ensuring a smooth user experience and prevents frustration. The colorful elements around the site guides the visitors in navigating around the page and finding information they want to open.</p>
